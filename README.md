# Game of Thrones Word2Vec Exploration

This project utilizes Word2Vec to analyze and visualize semantic relationships between characters and terms in the "Game of Thrones" series. By training a Word2Vec model on the text data from the books, we can uncover intriguing associations and patterns within the narrative.

## üìö Project Overview

- **Objective**: Explore semantic similarities in "Game of Thrones" using Word2Vec.
- **Dataset**: Text data from the "Game of Thrones" book series.
- **Techniques**:
  - Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal.
  - Model Training: Word2Vec with Gensim.
  - Visualization: t-SNE plots to visualize word embeddings.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the text data used for training.
- `game-of-throne.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing the Word2Vec model and visualizations.
